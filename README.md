## Motivation

- [Why you shouldnâ€™t scan two-factor authentication QR codes!](https://medium.com/crypto-punks/why-you-shouldnt-scan-two-factor-authentication-qr-codes-e2a44876a524)
- As a means of learning the Rust programming language.
- Easier to copy the OTP code from my terminal to the login form, rather than from
my phone to my laptop.

USAGE:
    cloak [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    add               Add a new account
    delete            Delete an account
    help              Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    list              List OTP for all accounts
    recovery_codes    View recovery codes for an account
    view              View the OTP for an account
```

To view the help of any of the subcommands below, add `-h` or `--help`, e.g. `cloak add -h`.

- `cloak add <account> <key>`

    This will add a new account. You will need to provide the name of the account
    as well as valid base32 encoded key. Example:

    ```bash
    $ cloak add github 4AZJFQFIGYM2KMTOO72I6FAOZ6ZFWJR6
    ```

- `cloak view <account>`

    This will print the TOTP/HOTP of the account you want to view. Example:

    ```bash
    $ cloak view github
    123456
    ```

- `cloak list`

    This prints all the accounts with their respective TOTP/HOTP codes. Example:

    ```bash
    $ cloak list
    Account: github
    TOTP: 607091

    Account: gitlab
    TOTP: 325414
    ```

- `cloak delete <account>`

    This will delete an account. Once deleted, you cannot view the OTP codes for
    the account. Example:

    ```bash
    $ cloak delete github
    Account successfully deleted
    $ cloak view github
    Account with the name 'github' does not exist. Consider adding it.
    ```

- `cloak recovery_codes <account>`

    This will open a file, using your preferred editor, to either save new recovery
    codes or view existing recovery codes.
